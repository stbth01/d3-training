## Critique Assignment #2
##### Brian Hunscher




### Viz 1
#### Pros
*The monthly and Quarterly charts:
** have a high ink to data ratio
** are clearly labeled
** very simplicstic, its clear what you can and can't change and what the comparison is against.
** the color choice is simple and straighforward
** 


#### Cons
*In the botton piece tabble and pie charts:
** (as usual) I don't like the use of pie charts here, using angle in something where you are probally interested in details and progress seems like a bad choice.
** its not clear what the user has control over here.
** it seems like you can select different months for the product and region comparison resulting in two charts next to each other that are showing different data.
** the table is really hard to read, in something with so much already going on I'm not sure what that table is trying to tell me.

 *The monthly and Quarterly charts have the wrong label its not revenue by product it revenuw for product over time.

####Alternative
Although I like the top of the half I was not sure we really need to columns so I made time dimension and option, which I think help clean up the page and make a little simpler. I got rid of the table because I was not sure what role it 
was playing and it seems to hold a good bit of information so this may be better on a seperate tab. Finally I got rid of the pie charts and replaced them with bar charts, simialr to the upper half instead of two charts I gave the use the 
option to see either the distribution by product or region. I also hoped to increase flexability of the tool by allowing the user to chose the time frame for the distribution with drop downs.


### Viz 2
#### Pros
* I think that its intuative which product the displays are about with the images along the left side, I assume they are clickable so the user can easily change the view.
* Each chart is titled clearly (I think, not sure you can compare sales and percent margin but...)

#### Cons
*I have no idea what is going with most of the charts:
** several of them are mixing chart types.
** Labels are unclear col 1 or row 1 mean.
** its very hard to tell these colors apart and match them with the key.
* the Sales vs. % Margin has two y-axis labels.
* (focus) I have no idea which chart is imporant
* the title of the chart as a whole "Product Insight" is not very informative.

####Alternative
Overall the original chart seems very complex both across and within individual charts. My redesign focuses on reducing this complexity by adding user interaction. This is a trade off in complexity by making the charts themselves simpler (fewer dimensions) the user may need to engage with the display before seeing the information they want. By allowing the user to pick between time or product views on each chart its easier to see trends in a particular dimension, however what is lost is the ability to compare products over time but this could be addressed with a separate tab.

I also removed the pie charts (because no one likes pie charts) because there is already two types of the charts in this visualization adding a third that is a challenge to map row to percentage in the pie seemed to be too burdensome further the same information could be displayed with bar charts.


### Viz 3
#### Pros
*The labels for the endzones, percentages and color key are very clear and easy to understand.
*Its easy to compare NO Saints with the Platform average. 

#### Cons
*The accesibility is a little hard when it comes to matching the colors in the key to the colors in the bar. It could be hard to match 7-14 days for examples.
*The is not a a very high ink to data ratio, with the chart in a fake notebook and table really big banner.
*I'm not sure what the purpose of the yard marks are besides making it look like a football field. I think they line up with the percentages but its not clear at what interval or if they are nesaccarly.
*Because they chose to use color for the different categories I understand why there are two keys but this information is redundent execpt for the color of the block.
*I think it a little hard to comare offseason with regualr season stats.


####Alternative
I tried to simplify the charts in a couple ways. First I removed the color key, instead there are different columns for different time periods. Second, the number of categories was reduced combining 7-14 and 14-30, I think this could be done further but would want client input before reducing further. Third, I think my display has a much higher ink to data ratio.

I changed the focus from comparing the team stats to the sites stats within each time period to comparing the team, site and time period within a return period. This was done to overcome a big drawback of the original in that it was hard to compare across time periods. Some detail was lost for the site stats (itâ€™s too crowded to label the site stats) but if the purpose of the chart is to display the team performance I think this compromise is acceptable for an increased ease of comparison on the time dimension while you are still able to get a rough comparison to site average.

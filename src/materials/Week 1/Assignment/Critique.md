## Critique Assignment #1
##### Brian Hunscher




### Viz 1
#### Pros
*There is a high data-ink ratio, there doesn't seem to be much on the page that is not tied to a data element
*This viz seems complete in that everything has a label, but the labels are not very informative.

#### Cons
*This is not very simplistic, there are two labels for the y-axis and its not clear which is for the bar and which is for the line (or even if that is the difference). There 7 products and 8 strategies which make for too many data point to take in at once without a clearer pattern.
*Its not clear where I should be looking, should I be focused on the line or the bars. Are we worried about a strategies or a products performance? This relates to the intentionality of the viz what is the purpose of the bars if we are looking at the performance of strategies.
*May be hard for color blind to see the different color bars for the products.
*Even though everything has a label the labels are not super helpful. What is strategy 1 or Product A? 

####Alternative
My alternative design is intended to reduce complexity by focusing on the totals. I took the products out of the viz because the title is "Compare sales strategies" as such it was not clear to me what the value was in comparing the products performance within each strategy. Further I tried to increase the completeness of the viz by giving the strategies titles. I think having some sort of information on each strategy can help give better context to why one may have out preformed the other.


### Viz 2
#### Pros
*It displays both percentages and totals.

#### Cons
*NO TITLE
*Not simplistic in the sense that there are too many layers to the bars. Which makes it hard to focus on any one element. Am I supposed to look at the total or look for the largest piece of a bar?
*The key is really hard to read.
*Its not clear why some percents are in a box and others are not. It clear I should focus on them but I don't know why.
*The percentages don't make sense. Some are negative and some are positive implying a change but without labels its not clear what the change is over. Change in ten years or change since a new policy?

####Alternative
This alternative design is intended to reduce complexity by removing the stacking within each bar and focusing instead on percent change. I'm making the assumption that the percentages are changes over time. I'm also removing the information about the individual company information, but I think allowing for some interactivity would better present the data in this viz. For example if you click on a bar you zoom in and see a stacked bar chart of just that bar or a new bar chart with the companies on the x-axis.


### Viz 3
#### Pros
*The labels on each individual charts seems clear and straight forward.
*Each individual chart is very simple without a lot going on within it.

#### Cons
*There is a low data to ink ratio, particularly with the image on the right side.
*The title is not very clear. It tries to be cute instead of informative.
*Its hard to tell the difference in the pumpkin sizes.


####Alternative
Overall I thought the original viz was good dashboard layout but got too cute with clip art. So I kept the layout its self but took out the clip art, in fact I even copy and pasted the bottom bar chart. The main feature I didn't agree with was the area perception of the circles in the two "average spending" charts. I think replacing with either a bar or line chart gives a better intuitive feel for the differences.

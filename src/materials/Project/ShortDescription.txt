The goal of my visualization is to give a casual observer be ability to explore the murder count reported within Michigan counties over time. I chose to have the front of my visualization be a map of Michigan to allow users to get a general view of where the most murders were happening in the state in given year. The user has the ability to select a year of interest by dragging the slider to a particular year or to see change over time by hitting play to progress through all the years in the data. Please note that a log scale was used because the murder rate in Wayne county is so high. The user can then click on a county to explore that county's data over time with either a bar or line chart. Currently the county view defaults to the bar chart at first, but the user can toggle back and forth to the line chart by clicking the switch button. Some counties only reported one or two murders in a decade while others could have reported hundreds every year, this visualization gives the user the choice of which chart they feel best describes the data at hand. Both the bar and line chart have mouse over displays that show the year and count that the data point represents.

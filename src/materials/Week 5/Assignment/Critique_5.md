## Critique Assignment #5
##### Brian Hunscher



### Viz 1
#### Pros
*Items are labeled clearly.
*Easily contrasted colors
*Each chart in the info graphic has a high data-ink ratio

#### Cons
*over all there a lot going on, on one page.
*There are a couple competing timelines. Two show '03 to '11, one shows to July 2010 but doesn’t say since when and another is from '03 to March '08.
    **This is confusing.
    **The author may have only had data for those time periods but may also have not wanted to show some time periods. In either case this may lead to some false or misleading conclusions.
*I see what the creator was going for with bars rounded and descending but I think it’s not necessary.
*I not so sure I know what the focus should be, there is a lot of information about military levels, military troop counts, military deaths, Civilian deaths, cause of deaths, where the deaths took place, count where military person was from who died and events at current points during the "war".

####Alternative
There was a lot going on with the original chart and a lot of useful information but it was a little overwhelming and unclear what the main takeaway should have been. It seemed that the main focus was the fact that a lot of people have died and was what the blood drips chart seemed to be focused on. That chart however doesn't need to be blood drips and for me the main takeaway was that number of people that died not when they died so I decided to remove the timeline and replace it with a head count graphic. I think I would prefer the scale to be lower like a dot per person or 10 people but still I think the scale of 1 dot to 100 conveys the main message that a lot of people died and the titles of the overall chart and the civilian and military deaths conveys the context.

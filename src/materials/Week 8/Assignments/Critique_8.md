## Critique Assignment #8
##### Brian Hunscher


### Viz 1
#### Pros
* I think the intro was laid out nicely. It seems to be a good template to tell a narrative about the data using the viz.
* The countries are labeled clearly.

#### Cons
* The intro is too long, I just want to skip it and start playing but I need it to do anything.
* not clear what source and target mean.
* its very hard to seem some of the countries lower down on the scale.
* not sure what the controls are doing and they are really hard to see.

####Alternative
I think the circles were very artist and I think would work well in a narrative but in an exploratory tool the current layout is very overwhelming. My alternative was intended to simply where the refugee are coming from and where they went. I would like the ability to click on a country to highlight it or give in a drop down. I like the coloring and curves in the original which is something I would like to keep.

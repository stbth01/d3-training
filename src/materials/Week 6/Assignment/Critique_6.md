## Critique Assignment #6
##### Brian Hunscher



### Viz 1
#### Pros
*The animation is timed at a good pace, meaning can you easy follow the data points around.
*There are a lot of options as a data exploration tool, perhaps for people familiar with the data.


#### Cons
*The labeling especially   for what the size of the dot means is very unclear.
*There is no context provided.
*I'm not sure what to focus on.
*the animation is not a clear option at first, so I'm not sure what role it plays in the intention of the chart.
*There are too many choices, again playing into the intentionality of the chart, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be getting out of it.
*circle as indicator are hard to compare.


####Alternative

I thought the chart was very interesting and the animation was very cool, but I was overwhelmed by the choices and was unclear what the message of the chart was indented to be. In my alternative I would leave the chart largely as is but remove the options to change what the size of the circle meant, countries included and color grouping selection. I think this removes a lot of what the chart is showing off but I think it allows for a clearer focus. I further attempted to add to the intentionality by focusing on three countries (either by focus on them like the chart can do now or removing all other countries) change over time and give the chart a title to that effect. Although I donâ€™t like using circle to compare given the animation I think it helps show general change over time but I added a key to help make it clearer what they represented, something I thought was missing before.

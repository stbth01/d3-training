## Critique Assignment #6
##### Brian Hunscher



### Viz 1
#### Pros
*For a map with a good amount of detail I think this good data to ink ratio.
*I like the color gradient, its seems clear to me.


#### Cons
*The labeling especially for what the size of the dot means is very unclear, what does value mean.
*There is no context provided, besides nyx_parks_monument.
*circle as indicator are hard to compare.


####Alternative
I like this map I think its clean but its missing context what do these dot actually mean? So I focused on improving the legend. I improved the title and replaced the word value with more descriptive label. There were also two scale covering seemingly the same info so I removed one, I decided to keep the circle the key because I think on think on this map with this color scheme its easier to compare sizes then colors to get general idea of where there are more monuments.

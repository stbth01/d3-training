## Critique Assignment #4
##### Brian Hunscher




### Viz 1
#### Pros
*There is a high ink to data ratio, there is not any extra images or anything
*What is labeled is labeled clearly, in terms of font and size.
*The colors are easy to read



#### Cons
*Missing a title or any source of context.
*Although each set of bars is labeled the label is not consistently  located.
*There are no units.

####Alternative
The context for this viz is very unclear, so I imposed one on it. In part because of the context I thought it was easy to compare the top priorities by party in a side by side bar chart. Although the topic labels in the old viz clearly showed which party had a higher count it was hard to tell by how much. The side by side makes this comparison  easier while also putting the labels in a consistent location.

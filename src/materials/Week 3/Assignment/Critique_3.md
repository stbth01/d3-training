## Critique Assignment #3
##### Brian Hunscher




### Viz 1
#### Pros
*There is a high ink to data ratio, there is not any extra images or anything
*Things are labeled clearly, both the axis labels and the title.
*The colors are easy to read



#### Cons
*Its not clear if we should focus on the number or the amount or the different between the two.
*Have two y-axis makes it hard to compare the overlaid charts.
*Even though the title tells you what is shown it doesn't say for what.

####Alternative
The biggest issue I saw with this viz was that we had two y-axisâ€™s, as such it was hard to know what was the actual focus of the chart. I attempted to address this issue by removing one y-axis, adding a statistic to be displayed and adding a drop down to pick the statistic to be displayed. By adding the average sale per order we can better see the change in per order sales that may have been part of the idea of having sales and orders on the same chart. By allowing the user to pick the statistic to be displayed we are not removing any information but make the chart simpler at the same time.
